                        All work performed in Scrum needs a set of values as the foundation for the team's processes and
                        interactions. And by embracing these five values, the team makes them even more instrumental to
                        its health and success.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong class="blue-text">Focus</strong><br/>
                        Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent
                        work. We deliver valuable items sooner.
                        <br/>
                        <strong class="blue-text">Courage</strong><br/>
                        Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives
                        us the courage to undertake greater challenges.
                        <br/>
                        <strong class="blue-text">Openness</strong><br/>
                        As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can
                        be addressed.
                        <br/>
                        <strong class="blue-text">Commitment</strong><br/>
                        Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.
                        <br/>
                        <strong class="blue-text">Respect</strong><br/>
                        As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help
                        each other become worthy of respect.

                        The following principles are based on the Agile Manifesto. <br/><br/>
                        1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of
                        valuable software.<br/><br/>
                        2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for
                        the customer's competitive advantage.<br/><br/>
                        3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
                        preference to the shorter timescale.<br/><br/>
                        4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.<br/><br/>
                        5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,
                        and trust them to get the job done.<br/><br/>
                        6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
                        team is face-to-face conversation.<br/><br/>
                        7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.<br/><br/>
                        8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should
                        be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.<br/><br/>
                        9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br/><br/>
                        10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.<br/><br/>
                        11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing
                        teams.<br/><br/>
                        12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
                        adjusts its behavior accordingly.<br/><br/>
